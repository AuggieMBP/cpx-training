# cpx-training
Super simple sample programs for [Circuit Playground Express](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3333).

## Development
The names of exercises from the Arduino version of the training have been added as a [project in the github repo page](https://github.com/mimiflynn/cpx-training/projects/1), so select one that interests you and start converting ;)

## Notes 
1. Disk Drive should have name CIRCUITPY instead of CPLAYBOOT, if CPLAYBOOT is displayed, you need to drag the CPX CircuitPython UF2 file over to the disk drive [UF2 file download link](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-circuit-playground-express/circuitpython-quickstart)

2. Choose "Adafruit CircuitPython" as Mode when using Mu editor

3. Mu attempts to auto-detect your board, so plug in your CircuitPython device and make sure it shows up as a CIRCUITPY drive before starting Mu

4. Name your Python file as code.py (Available filenames are: code.txt, code.py, main.txt and main.py)
